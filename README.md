# Porygon

_The very best, like no one ever was_

My contribution to the Stackathon of Grace Hopper cohort 1809 at Fullstack Academy.

Porygon is an AI that plays Pokemon Generation I- Red, Blue, Yellow- through the Pokemon Showdown server.

Roadmap:

- set up basic functions to interface with the Showdown API.
- set up a proof of concept AI that plays random moves.
- implement an AI that learns through its plays, via TensorFlow.js.
